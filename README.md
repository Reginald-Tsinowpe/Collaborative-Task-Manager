# Collaborative-Task-Manager
A Task Manager application for organizations to enable admins (Executives and Project managers) hand out tasks to regular users and track their progress

It is still in its planning stages.
Full development will begin before 1st February, 2025

I initially planned to use Google Drive API to store User Data and Task files, but ended up choosing firebase
